This document records the steps used to produce the Enhancer GTF for annotation

1.) Raw enhancer-gene collection
    - Collected from EnhancerAtlas
2.) Adult-specific data were collected for the following tissue types:
    - Brain
    - Liver
    - Small Intestine
    - Skeletal Muscle
    - Heart
3.) Ensemble gene ids were converted to gene names, e.g. (ENST.... -> CTCF)
    - process_enhancer_gene.py
4.) Tissue data were unioned together 
    - cat <all files>
5.) Unioned data was converted to a GTF
    - convert_enhancers_to_gtf.py
